🚀 About Me

I'm a Computer Science student with a unique background that bridges the gap between hardware discipline and software engineering.

My journey into tech didn't start with just code—it started with systems.
Serving as a Combat Mechanic in the Navy and working as an RMA Technician at Elbit Systems taught me how critical systems operate under pressure. I learned that whether you are fixing a marine engine or debugging a Java application, the core principles remain the same: logic, precision, and deep troubleshooting.

While many developers look only at the high-level code, my experience working with Assembly, C, and Hardware Diagnostics gives me a perspective on what happens "under the hood." I understand memory management, system constraints, and how to write efficient, optimized code.

Currently, I am diving deep into Android Development (Kotlin/XML) and Object-Oriented Programming, building applications that solve real-world problems.

💡 I believe that great software is like a well-oiled machine: reliable, efficient, and built to last.

🧠 What Makes Me Different

🔧 The "Mechanic" Mindset: My experience in the Navy and Elbit trained me to approach problems methodically. I don't just "patch" bugs; I look for the root cause, just like diagnosing a hardware failure.

🏗️ Full System Perspective: Because I’ve worked with Assembly and C, I write high-level code (in Java or Kotlin) with an awareness of memory allocation and low-level performance.

📱 User-Centric Development: In my Android projects, I focus heavily on the App Lifecycle and UI/UX, ensuring the application isn't just functional, but also intuitive for the user.
